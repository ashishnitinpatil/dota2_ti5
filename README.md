# Dota2 - The International 2015
This project hosts the python code/scripts used for the data pull and data processing for the 5th edition of the biggest e-sports tournaments of all times!

For analysis done on the data, please take a look at the [public tableau project](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ashish.nitin.patil#!/vizhome/Dota2-TheInternational2015/Totalwins).

The data was pulled from the [Dota2 web API](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=58317) with the help of the [dota2py](https://github.com/andrewsnowden/dota2py) python library. I've made some modifications and additions to the [original dota2py](https://github.com/andrewsnowden/dota2py) library and have used the modified one - [ashishnitinpatil/dota2py](https://github.com/ashishnitinpatil/dota2py).

To ease the data pulls, I've also created some handy scripts to aid me in the process, which are hosted at [ashishnitinpatil/dota2api_scripts](https://github.com/ashishnitinpatil/dota2api_scripts). Please note that this project is still in it's alpha phases, so expect less documentation, inefficient code, etc.

Please feel free to add to any of the projects mentioned!
